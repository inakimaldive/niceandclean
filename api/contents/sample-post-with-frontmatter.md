# Welcome to My Sample Post

This is the **body** of my sample post. It demonstrates how to include various elements in a markdown file.

## Features:

*   **Frontmatter:** Structured metadata at the beginning of the file.
*   **Markdown:** Easy-to-write syntax for formatting content.
*   **Tags:** Categorize your posts for better organization.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
